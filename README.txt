== Description ==

Merpress lets you create diagrams and visualizations using [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you make diagrams with this? =

Yes.  Checkout [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-syntaxReference) for syntax reference and example diagrams.

== Screenshots ==

1. Open the block by typing "/MermaidJS" (or use the sidebar and search)
2. Until there is a valid Mermaid diagram, there will be a syntax error in the graph.
3. When editing the block, there are 2 views.  Use the upper area for writing, and the lower for displaying the diagram.
4. When the block is not selected, it will be displayed as it should be seen on the site.
5. As seen on my test site.
